      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a Computer Science Engineering student who loves logic, mathematics,
        and problem solving. Through these, I've had a great interest in AI and
        Machine Learning from a research point-of-view. I like going to the
        depths of problems and understanding the underlying principles.
        Therefore, I prioritize understanding the fundamentals of a concept
        rather than a broad coverage of topics. This has greatly helped me carry
        out my research project and apply the same principles of problem solving
        to real-world problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have previously worked on research projects in Computer Vision that
        allowed me to understand how to apply theoretical concepts to practical
        problems.

        <strong>Effect of SNR Degradation in DNN Object Detection Models</strong
        ><br />
        This research project focuses on understanding how signal-to-noise ratio
        (SNR) impacts the performance of deep neural networks in object
        detection tasks. We simulate degradation in image quality and evaluate
        changes in accuracy and detection reliability across different object
        detection models. The insights from this study are intended to improve
        robustness of AI systems in noisy or low-quality visual environments,
        such as satellite imagery or low-light scenarios.

      <h2>Domain: OpenAI</h2>
      <p>
        OpenAIâ€™s mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity. I admire
        their work on models like GPT-4, Codex, and Whisper, and I hope to one
        day contribute to projects that advance aligned AI research.
